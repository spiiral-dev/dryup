### What Is DryUp?
DryUp is a ultra lightweight text editor for people who either don't have any disk space left or don't like using software that aint open source.

### How Do I Get It?
Well you have two options;
> 1) Download the installer and go through that <br>
or
> 2) Download and compile the python file through whichever method you like <br>


### Is It Free?
Yes! I may look into setting up a donation system, but at the moment I make nothing from this or any of my projects.
